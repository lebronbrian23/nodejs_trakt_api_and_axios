# IMPORTANT NOTES

Important code is found in the following files:
- .env (file where you'll put your important API info - e.g. keys, client ID, secret and redirect URI)

Modules have been added as dependencies so you just need to do **npm i**.

This example uses the [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) API. You'll need to create an account.
